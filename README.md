# RockPaperScissors
rock paper scissors game with javascript
in this project im going to make a rock paper scissors game using all my javascript knowledge, with the idea of learn new thing and reinforce what i already know


//actualization//
i finished my game, but i dont liked the results (it was a rock paper scissors that worked on the console.log). so i looked up for a tutorial on youtube so i can learn some new things, and here is the result,  i hope you like it!
